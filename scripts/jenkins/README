How to create a new Jenkins instance or restore a clean one from scratch

$ install-plugins.sh (follow the instructions) - loads necessary plugins from list
Restore previous files into ~/var/jenkins (if available):
- ~/var/jenkins/secrets/ : config on github has encrypted secrets and this step is critical to preserve them
- ~/var/jenkins/thinBackup.xml
Make sure groups/others don't have permissions to ~/var/jenkins/secrets/
Set up Config-as-code and run config-security-once.yaml followed by config.yaml
Set up a Job DSL seed job and run flowlogix/jenkins/CreateJenkinsJobs.groovy off github to create jobs

To sync up the config and find out what's changed,
download from Configuration-As-Code and diff with downloaded-config.yaml to see

Make sure to run master on the PR builder job, and then recreate the appropriate webhooks from Jenkins config screen
